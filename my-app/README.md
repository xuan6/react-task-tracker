# React Task Tracker App

This App includes a React-based UI and a JSON-server for the mock backend. The skeleton of this project was built based on the [YouTube React Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8). Xuan developed custom styles and addtional features to improve usability, such as enabling users to check/uncheck tasks, edit existing tasks, and choose date and time from a picker instead of typing strings.
